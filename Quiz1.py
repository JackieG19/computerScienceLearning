# WEEKS: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
# ---------------------
#        1  24hr. 1hr = 60min
# D      2  |
# A      3  |
# Y      4  |
# S      5  |
#        6  |
#        7  24hrs.


# 24 hours x 7 days

print 24 * 7
# = 168 hours in 7 days

# 168 hrs * 60 min = 10,080
# 10080 * 7 days

print 168 * 60 * 7
# 70560 min in 7 days
